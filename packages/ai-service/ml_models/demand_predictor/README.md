# Demand Predictor Model Directory
This directory contains the trained resource demand prediction model.

## Files:
- `model.pkl`: Trained demand prediction model
- `preprocessor.pkl`: Data preprocessor for model input

## Usage:
The model predicts resource requirements (personnel, vehicles, supplies) based on damage assessment and priority scores.

## Training:
Create a notebook similar to the priority scoring model to train this predictor with historical resource allocation data.
