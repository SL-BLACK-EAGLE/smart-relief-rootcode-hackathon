# SmartRelief - Decentralized Disaster Relief & Aid Coordination Platform

## üéØ Project Overview
SmartRelief is a next-generation disaster relief coordination platform that leverages cutting-edge technology to connect disaster victims, donors, volunteers, and relief organizations in real-time. The platform uses AI-powered damage assessment, predictive analytics, and geospatial intelligence to optimize resource allocation and maximize relief impact.

### Key Value Propositions:
